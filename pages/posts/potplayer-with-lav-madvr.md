I wrote a basic PotPlayer setup tutorial last year, but with a new monitor in hand this year, it's time to update to use the madVR version. The purpose of this article is to ensure smooth playback of most 24FPS animated videos while configuring madVR in a relatively convenient way, mainly for my laptop's current GTX1070 configuration.

## Required Software

Note: The following content may require some "special technology" to download, or you may need to find a domestic alternative source.

### PotPlayer

Please go directly to the [official website](https://potplayer.daum.net) to download the latest x64 version, which at the time of writing is 210929 (1.7.21564).

The only thing you need to pay attention to is to remember to check the box to install additional codecs in the last step.

### LAVFilters

Please go to [GitHub](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases) to download the latest version directly, the version at the time of writing is 0.75.1.

Just check LAV Video Decoder (x64), LAV Audio Decoder (x64) and LAV Splitter Source (x64) during installation.

### madVR

Please download the latest version directly from the [official website](http://madvr.com), the version at the time of writing is 0.92.17.

Run `install.bat` as administrator.

## System Settings

Adjust the system video-related dynamic range parameters to full. Take NVIDIA driver as an example, in the "Change resolution" section, adjust the depth to the desired value (the tutorial uses 8bit as an example) and change the dynamic range to "Full"; also change the dynamic range to "Full" in the "Adjust video color settings".
