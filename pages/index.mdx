<h2>Who am I</h2>

I'm WANG Ziwen, a student living in China. I write about my life and work mainly in Chinese, but sometimes I also write articles in English. I also write about my hobbies, which include reading, writing, and thoughts after reading novels or watching movies.

Thoughts and discussions are always welcomed.
